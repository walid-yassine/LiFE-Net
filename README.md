# [MIDL 2025] LiFE-Net: Longitudinal information Fusion for Enhanced lesion detection for liver CT scans

## Overview

Welcome to the repository for the paper **LiFE-Net: Longitudinal information Fusion for Enhanced lesion detection in unsupervised learning contexts"**, submitted to [*MIDL 2025 Conference*]() [*Longitudinal Disease Tracking and Modelling with Medical Images and Data*](https://2025.midl.io/). This repository will soon provide the code for the implementation of the LiFE-Net model, designed to improve lesion detection in liver follow-up CT scans by incorporating information from previous examinations.
